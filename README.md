# Git & GitHub Practice

This repository was created just as a part of a Git/GitHub practice. Main points covered:

  - Forking a repository from another GitHub user.
  - Cloning the newly created repository (forked) to my local environment.
  - Creating a new branch to make changes without changing the main branch.
  - Pushing the changes.
  - Opening a pull request to my own repository and also to the original repository (another GitHub user).
  - Reviewing the pull request, resolving conflicts and merging the pull request.
  - Deleting the new branch after the changes were merged.
